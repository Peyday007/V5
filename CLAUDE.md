# CLAUDE.md — operating instructions for Brain

Brain is a local-first research-operations platform. This file tells any agent working
on or through this repository how to behave. **It is not the database.** It records
rules, not state. Never write project state (which documents exist, which layers are
frozen) into this file — that lives in SQLite.

---

## 1. Query project state. Never guess it.

The authoritative operational state is:

```
DATABASE  (data/brain.db)
    +
FILESYSTEM  (data/projects/<project-slug>/documents/...)
    =
authoritative state
```

AI memory is **not** authoritative. Never state that a document exists because you
remember seeing it in a conversation. Verify first.

To read state without touching SQL:

- `GET /api/projects/:id` — project, layers, derived state, plan
- `GET /api/projects/:id/plan` — the Master Planner (NOW / NEXT / LATER / BLOCKED)
- `GET /api/projects/:id/next-action` — the single next best action
- `GET /api/layers/:id` — documents, runs, audits, dependencies, history
- `data/runtime/project-state.json` — a concise machine-readable snapshot, regenerated
  automatically whenever project state changes

The runtime JSON file is **derived state**. SQLite remains authoritative. If the two
disagree, the JSON is stale — re-run a recompute, do not edit the JSON.

If a document's database row exists but its file is gone, that is `INCONSISTENT STATE`.
If a file exists on disk but has no database row, that is an `UNREGISTERED FILE`.
Neither is "the document exists". Run **SCAN & RECONCILE**
(`POST /api/projects/:id/reconcile`) and resolve it.

## 2. Never ask the user to touch SQL.

No manual SQL, no pasted migrations, no database console, no manually added columns, no
hand-populated state rows. The user's loop is: change code → refresh/restart → the
database updates itself → the app loads. If you find yourself about to write "now run
this SQL", you have a bug to fix instead.

## 3. Every schema change requires a migration.

Schema lives in `server/db/migrations/NNN_name.sql` and is applied automatically on
boot, in order, each in its own transaction, with the applied version recorded in
`schema_migrations`.

- To change the schema, **add a new numbered migration file**. Never edit an applied one.
- Applied migrations are checksum-locked. Editing `001_initial.sql` after it has run
  makes the application refuse to boot with an explicit error — that is deliberate.
- Update the matching `*Row` type in `server/domain/types.ts` and the repository mapper
  in the same change, or the type contract silently drifts from the database.

## 4. Every research artifact must be registered.

A PDF sitting in the project folder is not a document. It becomes one only when it has a
row in `documents` with a canonical name, a version, a type, and a filesystem path.
Import through `server/services/importer.ts` (or `POST /api/projects/:id/import`), never
by copying a file into place by hand.

The **platform** owns the filename. The model's report title is never trusted:
`buildNames(layerName, version)` in `server/domain/naming.ts` is the single source of
truth for `canonical_name`, `conversation_title` and `filename`.

## 5. Preserve lineage. Never destroy history.

- A failed run is never overwritten, edited, or deleted. A redo creates a **new** run
  with `parent_run_id`, an incremented `attempt_number`, and a `redo_reason`.
- Superseded documents keep their rows and their files; they are the layer's provenance.
- `project_events` is append-only. Current state may mutate; history does not.
- Automatic redo loops stop at `versionPolicy.maxAutoRedos` (default 2), after which the
  run is marked as needing human review rather than looping.

## 6. Update state after every meaningful action.

The event that changes reality is the event that updates the database. Any code path
that imports a document, completes a run, records an audit, freezes or reopens a layer
must finish by calling `recomputeProject(projectId)` (or `recomputeLayer`) from
`server/services/stateEngine.ts`, which re-derives file state → dependencies → layer
status → next action → the runtime JSON.

There must be no workflow where the user has to remember "now go update the database".

## 7. Respect the project invariants.

1. No manual SQL in ordinary operation.
2. No manual migrations.
3. No important action without a `project_events` row.
4. No synthesis with missing dependencies unless the user explicitly overrides.
5. No redo that destroys failed-attempt history.
6. No frozen layer without a canonical artifact.
7. No AI state claim without querying current state.
8. No file treated as registered solely because it exists on disk.
9. No database record treated as healthy if its referenced file disappeared.
10. No generated prompt without recording the exact prompt and required attachments.
11. No audit result stored only as prose — always the structured record too.
12. No project state dependent on one chat transcript.

## 8. Model prose never mutates project state.

The dynamic audit engine (`server/services/audit/`) runs three separate roles —
primary auditor, adversarial critic, final judge — and only the judge's
**validated structured output** may reach `recordAudit`.

- Enums are matched exactly. No substring matching, no negation handling, no
  "closest verdict", no template placeholders, no inferred approval.
- The judge's counts are cross-checked against the gaps it classified, and an
  advancing verdict is refused outright while a foundational gap is open.
- An invalid response, a provider error, a timeout or an unreadable artifact is
  an **audit failure**: nothing is recorded and no state moves. The failure and
  the raw response are still persisted, because a verdict you cannot trace is
  not auditable.
- `parseAuditJson` in `auditEngine.ts` is the older, forgiving path for audits a
  human pastes in and reads first. `services/audit/schema.ts` is the path a
  model's own output takes, and it is deliberately stricter. Do not merge them.

Project-specific audit criteria live in `server/domain/auditProfile.ts`, one
profile per project. Never scatter `if (layer === 'Discovery')` through pipeline
logic — add to the profile instead.

## Conventions

- TypeScript ESM. **Relative imports include the `.ts` / `.tsx` extension.**
- `import type` for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax` is on).
- `strict` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` are on.
- SQLite parameters are positional `?` only, so both drivers behave identically.
- Booleans are `0`/`1` in the database and real booleans in view types; repositories are
  the only place the two representations meet.
- Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings.

## Checks before you call a change done

```
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Then verify the two boot paths that matter: migrating from an empty database, and
restarting against an existing one.

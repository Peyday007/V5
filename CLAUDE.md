# CLAUDE.md — operating instructions for Brain

Brain is a local-first research-operations platform. This file tells any agent working
on or through this repository how to behave. **It is not the database.** It records
rules, not state. Never write project state (which documents exist, which layers are
frozen) into this file — that lives in SQLite.

---

## 1. Query project state. Never guess it.

The authoritative operational state is:

```
DATABASE  (data/brain.db)
    +
FILESYSTEM  (data/projects/<project-slug>/documents/...)
    =
authoritative state
```

AI memory is **not** authoritative. Never state that a document exists because you
remember seeing it in a conversation. Verify first.

To read state without touching SQL:

- `GET /api/projects/:id` — project, layers, derived state, plan
- `GET /api/projects/:id/plan` — the Master Planner (NOW / NEXT / LATER / BLOCKED)
- `GET /api/projects/:id/next-action` — the single next best action
- `GET /api/layers/:id` — documents, runs, audits, dependencies, history
- `data/runtime/project-state.json` — a concise machine-readable snapshot, regenerated
  automatically whenever project state changes

The runtime JSON file is **derived state**. SQLite remains authoritative. If the two
disagree, the JSON is stale — re-run a recompute, do not edit the JSON.

If a document's database row exists but its file is gone, that is `INCONSISTENT STATE`.
If a file exists on disk but has no database row, that is an `UNREGISTERED FILE`.
Neither is "the document exists". Run **SCAN & RECONCILE**
(`POST /api/projects/:id/reconcile`) and resolve it.

## 2. Never ask the user to touch SQL.

No manual SQL, no pasted migrations, no database console, no manually added columns, no
hand-populated state rows. The user's loop is: change code → refresh/restart → the
database updates itself → the app loads. If you find yourself about to write "now run
this SQL", you have a bug to fix instead.

## 3. Every schema change requires a migration.

Schema lives in `server/db/migrations/NNN_name.sql` and is applied automatically on
boot, in order, each in its own transaction, with the applied version recorded in
`schema_migrations`.

- To change the schema, **add a new numbered migration file**. Never edit an applied one.
- Applied migrations are checksum-locked. Editing `001_initial.sql` after it has run
  makes the application refuse to boot with an explicit error — that is deliberate.
- Update the matching `*Row` type in `server/domain/types.ts` and the repository mapper
  in the same change, or the type contract silently drifts from the database.

## 4. Every research artifact must be registered.

A PDF sitting in the project folder is not a document. It becomes one only when it has a
row in `documents` with a canonical name, a version, a type, and a filesystem path.
Import through `server/services/importer.ts` (or `POST /api/projects/:id/import`), never
by copying a file into place by hand.

The **platform** owns the filename. The model's report title is never trusted:
`buildNames(layerName, version)` in `server/domain/naming.ts` is the single source of
truth for `canonical_name`, `conversation_title` and `filename`.

## 5. Preserve lineage. Never destroy history.

- A failed run is never overwritten, edited, or deleted. A redo creates a **new** run
  with `parent_run_id`, an incremented `attempt_number`, and a `redo_reason`.
- Superseded documents keep their rows and their files; they are the layer's provenance.
- `project_events` is append-only. Current state may mutate; history does not.
- Automatic redo loops stop at `versionPolicy.maxAutoRedos` (default 2), after which the
  run is marked as needing human review rather than looping.

## 6. Update state after every meaningful action.

The event that changes reality is the event that updates the database. Any code path
that imports a document, completes a run, records an audit, freezes or reopens a layer
must finish by calling `recomputeProject(projectId)` (or `recomputeLayer`) from
`server/services/stateEngine.ts`, which re-derives file state → dependencies → layer
status → next action → the runtime JSON.

There must be no workflow where the user has to remember "now go update the database".

## 7. Respect the project invariants.

1. No manual SQL in ordinary operation.
2. No manual migrations.
3. No important action without a `project_events` row.
4. No synthesis with missing dependencies unless the user explicitly overrides.
5. No redo that destroys failed-attempt history.
6. No frozen layer without a canonical artifact.
7. No AI state claim without querying current state.
8. No file treated as registered solely because it exists on disk.
9. No database record treated as healthy if its referenced file disappeared.
10. No generated prompt without recording the exact prompt and required attachments.
11. No audit result stored only as prose — always the structured record too.
12. No project state dependent on one chat transcript.

## 8. Model prose never mutates project state.

The dynamic audit engine (`server/services/audit/`) runs three separate roles —
primary auditor, adversarial critic, final judge — and only the judge's
**validated structured output** may reach `recordAudit`.

- Enums are matched exactly. No substring matching, no negation handling, no
  "closest verdict", no template placeholders, no inferred approval.
- The judge's counts are cross-checked against the gaps it classified, and an
  advancing verdict is refused outright while a foundational gap is open.
- An invalid response, a provider error, a timeout or an unreadable artifact is
  an **audit failure**: nothing is recorded and no state moves. The failure and
  the raw response are still persisted, because a verdict you cannot trace is
  not auditable.
- `parseAuditJson` in `auditEngine.ts` is the older, forgiving path for audits a
  human pastes in and reads first. `services/audit/schema.ts` is the path a
  model's own output takes, and it is deliberately stricter. Do not merge them.

Project-specific audit criteria live in `server/domain/auditProfile.ts`, one
profile per project. Never scatter `if (layer === 'Discovery')` through pipeline
logic — add to the profile instead.

## 9. An audit reads extracted evidence, never raw bytes.

A file on disk is not something Brain has read. `server/services/documents/`
turns a stored file into an **extraction run**: pages, ordered blocks, raw text
beside normalized text, a quality verdict, and chunks with page anchors.

- Only a run that reached `READY` or `READY_WITH_WARNINGS` is evidence. A
  `BLOCKED`, `FAILED` or `INTERRUPTED` document is something the auditor does
  **not** have, and every code path must say so rather than treating an empty
  extraction as an empty document.
- One unreadable member blocks a whole packet audit. A layer verdict that
  quietly skipped a document is the false confidence this engine exists to
  prevent.
- Extraction runs are append-only. Reprocessing creates a new run and marks the
  old one superseded (`supersedePreviousRuns`), so an audit recorded months ago
  still resolves to the text it actually read. Exactly one run is current.
- OCR is a local capability Brain discovers, version-checks at startup and
  reports. Only pages with no usable text layer are recognised, and a recognised
  page carries its provenance: the engine, its version, the sha-256 of the exact
  rendered image, the resolution, and a confidence per page and per block. With
  no engine installed, pages that need one are reported unreadable — never passed
  on as empty content, and never sent anywhere else to be read.
- A recognised page below `ocrConfidenceFloor` counts as unread. Confidence is
  evidence, so it gates: a document must not become READY merely because OCR
  returned some characters.
- A document that is registered and present but unreadable is not evidence, so
  its layer is BLOCKED and the plan says to reprocess or replace it. A layer that
  reads AUDIT_READY while its only document cannot be read is a lie the planner
  must never tell.
- Normalization may only remove extraction artifacts. `raw_text` is kept beside
  `normalized_text` on every block, so cleanup can never be the only copy of the
  evidence.

## 10. Every conclusion must resolve to a passage.

`retrieveEvidence` answers a question from the extracted text and returns three
things, all of which matter: the passages, the documents it searched, and the
documents it could not read. An empty result over an unread document means "not
read", not "not present" — and only Brain can tell those apart.

- `recordAuditEvidence` attaches passages to each gap after a verdict is
  recorded, retrieved from the text rather than quoted by the model. A citation
  is therefore a fact about the document, not a claim about it.
- Structured findings (`services/documents/findings.ts`) are an index over a
  document, never a replacement for it. A finding whose quote cannot be located
  in the extracted source is discarded, and the page number comes from the block
  the quote was found in — never from the model.
- Findings are never derived from the mock provider. Inventing an index is worse
  than having none.

## 11. A filename is a hint. Only the contents are understanding.

Some sources belong to the project rather than to a layer: a master chat
transcript, a working log, a pasted session. `documents.scope` says which —
`LAYER`, or `PROJECT_MASTER_TRANSCRIPT` / `PROJECT_SOURCE` for the rest. A
project-wide source is registered with `layer_id = NULL` on purpose, and that is
not an orphan; forcing it into one layer would file most of its content under the
wrong heading.

- Storing a file is not reading it. `services/sources/ingest.ts` extracts,
  normalizes, chunks, segments, classifies and reports, and nothing counts as
  ingested until that has run. "It is in the folder" is invariant 8 again.
- Segments follow the text's own boundaries — speaker, timestamp, heading,
  separator, topic — not a fixed character count. Chunks are for finding text;
  segments are for understanding it. A segment carries the block range and the
  character offsets it came from, so every claim about a transcript resolves to
  a passage in it.
- Classification reads the passage, against the layer vocabulary the project's
  own audit profile already declares. `classification_source` records which:
  `FILENAME` is a hint, `CONTENT` is understanding, and the difference must be
  visible in the UI rather than implied.
- One segment may link to several layers and versions. Every link carries a
  confidence and a rationale, is created as `PROPOSED`, and becomes evidence only
  when a person accepts it. Re-reading the file replaces the proposals and keeps
  the decisions — they are re-anchored by the passage's content hash, because a
  decision belongs to the text rather than to a row.
- Imported text is untrusted data. A passage that reads like an instruction is
  detected, flagged in the ingestion report and stored as ordinary text. Nothing
  found inside a file is ever executed, and none of it may move project state.
- Never send a whole transcript to a provider. `selectRelevantSegments` picks the
  passages that bear on one question inside a character budget.

## 12. Breadth comes from fragments. Correctness is enforced inside each one.

One conversation is not responsible for a broad subject, and one giant prompt is
not deep research. `services/research/` decomposes an assignment into 5–15
bounded fragments, researches each as its own job, and lets only the fragments
that clear their evidence gate contribute anything.

- A fragment declares what it is: one bounded question, the evidence lanes it
  needs, acceptable and excluded source types, its geography, timeframe,
  population and definitions, completion criteria, the minimum independent
  sources, and the fragments it depends on. Those declarations are what the gate
  is applied against, so a fragment with none of them cannot be judged and is
  refused at the planning pass.
- Seven conditions decide whether a claim may be synthesized: a canonical source
  URL; a source that directly supports it; the exact passage or locator; scope,
  date, geography and definitions matching the fragment's; contradictions
  resolved or explicitly retained; the fragment's lanes covered and its
  independent-source minimum met; and any calculation resting on inputs that are
  themselves accepted claims. `services/research/gate.ts` applies all seven.
- Two of those are judgements only a reader of the source can make — whether it
  supports the claim, and whether the scope lines up — so a separate verification
  pass answers them per claim and Brain records the answer. Brain's part is to
  insist the answer exists and to apply it without exception, never to infer it.
- A rejected claim keeps its rejection reason forever, and a rejected fragment
  contributes nothing at all. Acceptance is decided once, at the gate, so nothing
  can re-enter through a later attempt's synthesis.
- A failed fragment is repaired, narrowed, or re-run with a different search
  strategy chosen from what actually failed — up to `MAX_FRAGMENT_ATTEMPTS`, and
  every attempt stays in the table as failure history.
- The synthesis reads the accepted ledgers only, and the filed report carries the
  ledger inside it so every sentence resolves to a claim id, a URL and a passage.
  Then the existing primary / adversarial / judge audit runs on the packet.
- Every pass is written down before the provider is called and completed after
  it, with the exact prompt, its sha-256 and the raw reply. That is what makes a
  crash survivable: `recoverInterruptedResearch` closes what a dead process left
  open, and a completed pass is never bought twice.
- The engine's readiness and the worker's readiness are separate answers with
  separate remedies, and the UI shows both. A provider that returns placeholder
  content declares `placeholder: true` and is refused for staged research
  outright — a report of invented citations is the worst thing this platform
  could produce.

## Conventions

- TypeScript ESM. **Relative imports include the `.ts` / `.tsx` extension.**
- `import type` for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax` is on).
- `strict` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` are on.
- SQLite parameters are positional `?` only, so both drivers behave identically.
- Booleans are `0`/`1` in the database and real booleans in view types; repositories are
  the only place the two representations meet.
- Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings.

## Checks before you call a change done

```
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Then verify the two boot paths that matter: migrating from an empty database, and
restarting against an existing one.
